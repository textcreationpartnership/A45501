            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Courteous Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN this elaborate Work, thou wilt find ſuch Satisfaction, as perhaps the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or paſt Ages, have not before afforded thee. If Health is held valueable in your Eyes, and you would avoid the Pains and tediouſneſs of Sickneſs, or Grievances incident to Human Bodies; here you may repair to an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> and find the <hi>Arcana</hi> opened for your Good, which have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto locked up from the greater part of Mankind. All <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and <hi>Hard Terms,</hi> or <hi>Words,</hi> are removed, which have puzled Ingenious Perſons, and the Path is made ſo ſmooth that any reaſonable Capacity or Underſtanding may travel in it
<pb facs="tcp:47330:3"/> without the leaſt fear of Stumbling or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into Error, if ſome particular Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that will herein occur, are uſed as a Guide and Conductor. For, I confeſs, in weighty Matters, ſuch as tend to the Preſervation of Health; the preciouſeſt Jewel of Life, things ought to be well weighed and conſidered, that every thing may concur with the Ends for which it was deſign'd and made publick, which is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Mankind.</p>
            <p>That it is called a <hi>FAMILY-DICTIONARY,</hi> ſhows it is intended for the Publick Good, containing ſuch Things as cannot in one way or other miſs of their deſigned Ends, in being Uſeful and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to thoſe that ſtand in need of Good Advice or Directions, and will be ſo wiſe or kind to themſelves, as to conſult their own Benefit in what is contained in this Book, it being a Mixture of many Rarities that have (when practiſed in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate) given Contentment even to Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:47330:3"/> and anſwered the End beyond Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Here you will not only find Phyſical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts for the moſt reigning Diſtempers, Diſeaſes, and Grievances, incident to Engliſh Bodies; but how to Prepare and Adminiſter them in the beſt and propereſt Ways and Methods: So that every one may be provided with Remedies when Neceſſity calls for them, and a Phyſician or Surgeon are not to be had: which may be done with little Coſt and Labour. The Rich, being Charitably diſpos'd, may find an eaſie Means to exerciſe their Charity, in helping the afflicted Poor; and even Gardens and Fields may afford Relief, without any Coſt, to eaſe the Pains and Miſeries of thoſe that labour under tedious and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Diſtempers, or Grievances, when Friends may fail.</p>
            <p>Here you are alſo taught how to make all ſorts of Wines, Cyders, Metheglins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47330:4"/> and ſeveral ſorts of Cordial-Waters, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes, Waſhes, Beautifying-Waters, and other Rarities of the like Nature.</p>
            <p>All ſorts of Cookery are herein nicely diſplayed; and the whole Myſtery of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: with many other Things too tedious to be recited in a Preface: So that the Roſes are twined with the Geſſamine, and many other Fragrant Branches, bearing curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Flowers of Profit and Advantage, to render it a Garland lovely and acceptable.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I further ſay, but that it is recommended to the World by Ingenious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have peruſed it, as a Curious Piece done in an eaſie Method to direct the Reader in what he is deſirous to know, or practiſe. And will not only do Good to the preſent, but future Ages: Be a Helper at Need, and treaſur'd up as a Jewel by thoſe who will undoubtedly find their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations anſwered in the Particulars they require to be ſatisfied about.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:47330:4"/>
            <p>To conclude, what is not done from the exacteſt Experience, is taken with Care and Caution from the moſt approved Authors as well Ancient as Modern.</p>
            <p>Take it then as you find it, and let neither Fear, ſmall Charges, or Neglect, deter you from practiſing what is convenient or advantagious for your Health, as occaſion offers, or requires it: And may every thing ſucceed according to your Wiſhes and Deſires.</p>

               <head>Meat and Drink obſerved for the contributing to Health, and the Preſervation of it.</head>
               <p>NOuriſhment is a neceſſary Part for the Preſervation of Health: for as they are temperate, or intemperate; ſo good or evil Juices have their Effects in the Body of Men and VVomen, as the Food we eat is of hard or eaſie Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or Digeſtion. The Temperate is ſuch Meats, as being taken in due order, cauſe no Diſtemper, as Bread well made of VVheat. The Intemperate are thoſe, that by ſome quality do alter the State of our Bodies; as for example, VVine, Muſtard, Garlick, Leeks, Onions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do heat: and ſo does Pottage made with hot Herbs, as Hyſſop, Thyme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bread made of Barly, Grapes; and Pottage made with cool Herbs, as Lettuce, Sorrel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do cool.</p>
               <p>Some kind of Nouriſhments breed Flegm, ſome Choler, ſome Melancholy, and ſome Excrements only. Thoſe that principally generate good Blood, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Red VVine, Milk, Eggs, the Fleſh of Hens, Capons, and Birds, are to be preferred before any other ſorts of Fleſh, either Kid, or Veal, becauſe they generate better Juice. Black and thick VVines breed ill Juice: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> like does Beef, Goats-fleſh; but worſt of all, that of Bulls, Brawn, and Ram-fleſh. Bread that is made of yellow and ſweet VVheat, well dreſt, is beſt for Nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>All manner of Peaſe breed VVind, and encreaſe Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Beans that are green, are cold and moiſt, and generate crude Blood and VVind: Dried Beans are cold, and dry; ſo that the Flowers thereof are much uſed in Cataplaſms that are to dry and cool, as in hot Impoſtumes of the Paps. Rice is a great Binder, and therefore uſed in Clyſters to ſtop Lasks: it generates thick Juice, and Obſtructions in the Veins, if it be much eaten. All Fiſh do of themſelves yield a cold and moiſt Nouriſhment, and much Flegm; yet let the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Meat be never ſo good, too much in quantity, or unſeaſonably taken, will cauſe the Nouriſhment to prove Evil: for Gluttony, and Intemperance are the greateſt Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of the Phyſicians. Therefore, if we regard our Healths, we ſhould eat and drink to live, and not live to eat and drink; and certain it is, that thoſe who regard their Healths, ought to be moderate in both: and therefore it is
<pb facs="tcp:47330:184"/> the beſt way to eat little at a time, that there be always a good Appetite and Digeſtion; likewiſe to keep due order and time in our Meats and Drinks. Good VVine is nouriſhing; as alſo the Liquors of our own Country growth that have Age and Clearneſs.</p>

               <p>MOderate Labour, or Exerciſe, where the whole Body is actively employed, contributes much to Health, by ſtirring the Humours, and ſweating out what is noxious or offenſive: but the Body continuing in idleneſs, gathers much Flegm and Excrements, which would be diſſipated by Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; for it helps the natural Heat, quickens the Spirits, makes the Senſes the better perform their ſeveral Offices, opens the Pores of the Body, and by perſpiration waſts the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement that other ways would afflict it: finally, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth all the Spirit and Members, that they may the better undergo their Function. In Exerciſe, conſider firſt the time, which is the fitteſt before Meat; ſecondly, the manner of the Exerciſe, which is general, or particular, as playing at Ball, or Leaping particularly, as when one Part only is exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as the Legs by walking, the Arms by another Motion; the Belly is ſtirred by riding, and the Lungs by much Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or loud calling. Now as there are many Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies by Exerciſe uſed in due quality and time, ſo are there many inconveniencies and dangers proceeding from Reſt and Idleneſs; as Crudities, Obſtructions, Stone in the Reins, and Bladder, Gouts, and Apoplexy, and ſundry others: and it not only dulleth the principal Inſtruments of our Body, but alſo of our Mind.</p>

               <p>Alſo in our lying down to ſleep, we muſt obſerve to do it on the right ſide, that the Digeſtion may be more eaſie in the bottom of the Stomach, which is hotter, and about an hour after, if you be waking, you may turn on the Left ſide, that the Liver with its Lobes may embrace the Ventricles, and as a Fire under a Furnace, haſten the Digeſtion; but lye as little as may be on the Back or Face; for Exceſs of the firſt often cauſes Inflammations of the Reins and Stone, Palſie, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the uſual Diſeaſes proceeding from the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: The latter cauſes Defluxions and Rheums.

               <head>The Moſt Acceptable Pieces to be preſented at the Table to Friends or Strangers.</head>
               <p>IN Boiled Chickens preſent the Breaſt, and next to that, the Leg; for in all boiled Fowl, the Leg is better accounted than the Wing, though in roaſted ones the contrary; eſpecially if Wild-Fowl. In Pullets, Turkeys, Capons, Geeſe, Duck, Mallard, Dottrel, Pheaſant, and ſuch like, the Merrythought is moſt acceptable; and the Wing next, or the Leg; and the next part is that laced down on the Breaſt-bone, in Roaſted Fowl.</p>
               <p>In Butchers Meat, preſent the Inſide of the Sirloin of Beef; and in other pieces that which is curiouſly ſtriped with fat and lean: and ſo in boiled Beef. In a Loin of Veal, chooſe the Nut-piece or Kidney-piece. In a Leg of Mutton, the little
<pb facs="tcp:47330:189"/> round bone that is on the inſide, above the handle; for this is greatly in eſteem among the Curious. I heard of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Gentleman who came from Hunting to the Remainder of a Leg of Mutton, who would not eat becauſe he thought Clowniſh greaſie Fellows had had the handling of it, ſince they had not the Underſtanding to chooſe that bone before all the other parts of it.</p>
               <p>In a Shoulder of Mutton, preſent that between the handle and flap. In a roaſted Pig, the under Jaw and Ear, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Women; next thoſe, the Neck-piece. In a Hare, Coney, or Leverit, the Middle-piece, or the Tail-piece, called the Huntsmans Piece. In Fiſh, the Jole, or that Part next the Head, or in Shell-Fiſh the Claw of a Lobſter or Crab.</p>
               <p>If Fiſh, or ſliced Fleſh be in Paſte, touch it with your Fork, Knife, or Spoon, raiſe it handſomely, and lay on a Plate the beſt you find, with a piece of the Lid. As for Tarts, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, Cakes, and Sweet-meats, you muſt preſent them, cut or whole, as their bigneſs is, on the point of your Knife.</p>

               <head>How to keep Alive and fatten divers ſorts of Choice Wild Fowl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO bring up a Hern the beſt way, is to take it out of the Neſt before it can fly, and put it into a large Barn where there are many croſs Beams; let it have a conveniency of Water, and feed it with raw fleſh cut into convenient pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either of Beef or Liver, or Dogs fleſh, but no Swines fleſh, keeping the place ſweet and clean; for they much delight in it; and in this manner you may bring up and fatten Pullets, Gulls, Bitterns, and the like.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47330:190"/>
               <p>To feed Partridges, Pheaſants, Quail, and Wheat-ears, do it with good Wheat and Water, giving it them Morning, Night, and Noon; but if you would have them extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Crammed Fowl, then take the fineſt dreſt Wheat-meal, mix it with Milk, and make it into Paſts; and ever as you knead it, ſprinkle in the Grains or Corns of Wheat, then make ſeveral Crams, and dip them in Water, and give every Fowl according to his bigneſs, that his Gorge may be well filled, and ſo in Fourteen Days they will be Fat beyond Meaſure, and thus you may do by Turtle Doves, or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons.</p>
               <p>To feed Godwits, Knots, Gray Plover, and Curlews, Take Chilter'd Wheat, the fineſt ſort, and give them Water thrice a Day, Morning, Noon, and Night, which will be very effectual, do as you did by the former,</p>
               <p>To feed Black-Birds, Thruſh, Feldfair, or any ſmall Birds whatever, being taken Old and Wild; It is good to have ſome of their Kind Tame among them, and then putting them into great Cages of Three or four Yards Square, to have divers Troughs placed therein, ſome filled with Haws, ſome with Hemp, and Rape ſeed, and others with Water; the Tame teaching the Wild to Eat, and the Wild finding ſuch alteration of Food, they will in Twelve or Fourteen Days grow exceeding Fat, and fit for the Kitchen.</p>
               <p>Ducklings are Fatted with Pulſe or Grain, and ſtore of Water. Goſlings, with Skeg-oats, boiled and given them thrice a Day. Geeſe, by putting them into Pens which are cloſe and dark, and there feed them thrice a Day with ſtore of Oats, and Split Beans, and give them Water and Barly-meal mixt together. For Chickens, when the Hen has forſaken them, make a Paſt of Wheat-meal, and Milk, and wet it often in Milk when it is rouled up, and let not the Crams be too big, for fear of Choaking them. To Fatten Capons, make Crams of Barley-meal and Milk, and keeping them up in a Coop, give them their full Gorge, Three times a Day, and ſo that they may eaſily go down, let them be dipt in Milk. For Turkies, having Coopt them up, place Two Troughs, one full of VVater and Barly, and the other full of Old dried Malt, and they will be very Fat in a Month.</p>
